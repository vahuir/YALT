# YALT!: Yet Another Labeling Tool!

After installing the module, the folder where you will execute the program should contain a folder named `task`, which will contain the following files:

- `body.html`: The configuration file of the labeling task.
- `validation.yaml`: The dictionary to validate the labeling.

The samples have the extension `.sample` with JSON content format. After saving a labeling task, the `.labels` file will be created in the same place where the sample file is placed.

`WARNING!` This application is in an early development stage, and it is provided as is.
